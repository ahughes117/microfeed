tinyfeed
========

I began tinyfeed as my personal blog-diary-twitter. It's not a blog (at least I don't use it this way) and it's not twitter.

I use it for posting my thoughts, ideas, anger, frustration every day. Why should I post these things? I don't know, I just like it and I just can.

Probably, I will never grow up. You, other non-grown-ups out there who enjoy making-modifying-improving things, feel free to contact me, for whatever question or comment you have.
